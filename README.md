**IMPORTANT INFORMATION:** All information in this GitHub repository is strictly for educational purposes, and I will not be held responsible if you use it for any other purpose, if you do decide to put your newly acquired knowledge to good use, you do so at your own risk and expense. Its not my fault if you end up in prison lol.

I made this repository so I have an easy place to find everything to do with hacking/viruses and so i can educate people about what you should watch out for in code (primarily the first one tho).

All the Information can be found on the Wiki
